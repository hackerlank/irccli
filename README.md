# irccli
A minimal command line IRC client

## Todo
- Consolidate both the ipv4 and ipv6 files into a single working script which detects which to use
- Handle PING messages and respond with PONG
- Allow the user to send messages
 - Add alias functions the user can type (e.g., join instead of JOIN)
