# irccli
A minimal command line IRC client

## Todo
- Test that the IPv6 and IPv4 works on a network where the client IP is IPv4
- Handle PING messages and respond with PONG
- Allow the user to send messages
 - Add alias functions the user can type (e.g., join instead of JOIN)
- Clean up code into separate functions and util files
- Clean up output using regular expressions
